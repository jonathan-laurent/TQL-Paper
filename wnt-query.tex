\subsubsection*{Undoing S45, T41, S37 and S33 phosphorylation}
Considering phosphatases undoing the phosphorylation of
sites, does this happen to all agents? Does it happen to just a few agents? What is the distribution of dephosphorylation events per agent? (Figure~\ref{F1})

%match e:{c:Cat(S45{ph/un})}
%return (agent_id{c}, time[e])

%match e:{c:Cat(T41{ph/un})}
%return (agent_id{c}, time[e])

%match e:{c:Cat(S37{ph/un})}
%return (agent_id{c}, time[e])

%match e:{c:Cat(S33{ph/un})}
%return (agent_id{c}, time[e])

    \m{match} & e:\Set{ 
      \iAG{c}{\BetaCat}{{#1}^{\,1}_{\Trans{p}{u}}}
    } \\
    \m{return} & \AgentId{c},\, \Time{e}

\subsubsection*{Wait times}

What is the distribution of times spent
between the first phosphorylation on an agent, and the time it gets
degraded? (Figure~\ref{F2})

%match i:{+c:Cat}
%and first p:{c:Cat(S45{un/ph})} after i
%and first d:{-c:Cat} after p
%return (agent_id{c}, time[p], time[d])

\begin{small}
\begin{equation}
  \Query{
    \m{match} & i:\Set{  c:\BetaCat+ } \\
    \m{and} & \FirstAfter{p:\Set{
        \iAG{c}{\BetaCat}{{S45}_{\Trans{u}{p}}}
    }}{i} \\
    \m{and} & \FirstAfter{ d:\Set{
        c:\BetaCat-
    } }{p} \\
    \m{return} & \Time{d} - \Time{p}
  } 
\end{equation}
\end{small}

\noindent \textit{About this query.} Agent creation and destruction is
expressed by suffixing agent names with $+$ and $-$,
respectively.

\subsubsection*{Component size and enzyme identity} 
Where do the phosphorylation steps that actually lead to degradation
occur? Do they happen mostly on large complexes? What is
the composition in units of Axn and APC of the complexes where the
phosphorylation events leading to degradation took place? What is the distribution of kinase identifiers for the last phosphorylation events that lead to degradation? (Figure~\ref{F6})

\noindent \textit{About this query.} The \textsf{component} state
measure computes the connected component that contains an agent in a
mixture. It returns a set of agents $S$. The \textsf{count} function
takes such a set $S$ along with $n$ strings denoting agent types and
returns an $n$-tuple of integers indicating how many agents of each
type appear in $S$.
